Product Card Design Description (Revised)
This is a minimalist, image-focused e-commerce product card designed for a grid layout. It has two states: a Default State and a Hover State.
1. Default State
A. Card Container & Layout
Shape: Vertical rectangle with sharp corners.
Background: A very light, neutral grey (e.g., #F5F5F5).
Structure: Composed of two main vertical sections: the upper Image Area and the lower Information Area.
B. Image Area (Top 80% of the card)
Content: The entire area is filled with a full-size product image. The image must have a transparent background (e.g., PNG format), allowing the card's light grey background to show through around the product.
Badges/Tags (Top-Left Corner):
Two small, rectangular badges are placed horizontally next to each other with minimal spacing.
The first badge has a bright yellow background with black, uppercase text: "SALE".
The second badge has a white or very light grey background with black, uppercase text: "NEW".
Image Carousel Indicators (Bottom-Center):
A series of small, solid circular dots are centered horizontally just above the bottom edge of the image area.
The active image is indicated by a black dot.
Inactive images are indicated by light grey dots.
C. Information Area (Bottom 20% of the card)
Padding: Consistent padding on the left and right sides.
Layout: A two-column layout. The left column contains text information, and the right column contains an action icon.
Left Column (Text):
Product Name: A short, descriptive title.
Product Code/SKU: Placed directly below the name, in a smaller, lighter-weight font.
Price: The most prominent text element, displayed in a large, bold, vibrant red font. Includes the currency symbol.
Right Column (Icon):
Wishlist Icon: A simple, outlined heart icon, vertically aligned with the Product Name.
2. Hover State
The hover state is triggered when the user's cursor moves over the entire card. It introduces a new "Size Selector" panel with a smooth animation.
A. Overall Transition
Animation: The "Size Selector" panel animates into view from the bottom of the Image Area, smoothly pushing the entire Information Area downwards. The card's overall height remains fixed.
B. Changes and New Elements
New Element: Size Selector
Position: Appears between the Image Area and the Information Area.
Layout: A horizontal list of available sizes (e.g., "36", "37", "38").
Styling: Sizes are displayed as bold numbers with even spacing between them.
Status Indicators: Some sizes may have a small icon below them: a red-outlined circle containing a clock symbol, indicating a special status like "Low Stock".
Information Area: This entire block (Name, Code, Price, Icon) is shifted downwards, with its top portion being obscured to make space for the Size Selector.
Cursor: The cursor changes from the default arrow to a pointer (hand icon).
Global Styling & Typography Notes
